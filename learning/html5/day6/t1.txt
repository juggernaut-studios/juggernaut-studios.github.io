In HTML
<html manifest="mysite.appcache" type="text/cache-manifest">

Create file named
<user_defined_name>.appcache


Starting line of the file

# -- indicates comments & also required for checking the version
Now start mentioning the assets which needs to loaded locally

5MB in chrome - if your app contains more then the Application Cache Progress event will never be triggered so the application-would never be cached.
